This is a revamped version of a wireless network topology that I wish we could have deployed for a private school 10 years ago, 
long before I had any real IT networking skills. The scope of the project was to:

1) Switch from analog bookwork to a virtual classroom tailored for each student.

2) Support up to 25 students in various grade ranges to stream 480p video.

3) Pioneer a more novel, better way of instructing multiple students at once while not only maintaining quality teaching but even exemplify it.



Unfortunately, we did not have the expertise to create a wireless infrastructure to accommodate the scope we wanted. I'm relatively confident we would 
have been one of the first to implement a design like this as well because online classes with a local administer were never really popularized until the advent of COVID-19.
