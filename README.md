# Packet-Tracer-project-labs

Repository to hold small network projects and CCNA labs to help with the current version August 20, 2024 
v1.1 CCNA exam (no braindumps) as a free alternative. If money can be invested, Boson netsim would be a 
guaranteed pass on your CCNA lab configurations: https://www.boson.com/netsim-cisco-network-simulator

Labs focused on the CCNA will be under the exam topics https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics where it
says "configure". example being:

1.0 Network Fundamentals <br>
1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix

would have some labs where you would need to configure the IPv6 address and the proper prefix on an interface. Again, 
these are not braindumps but rather labs that should help establish the fundamentals of network configuration within Cisco's CLI.

Non-CCNA labs are to either function as templates, proof-of-concepts or showcases and shouldn't necessarily reflect
a 1-to-1 translation of a real network. This is primarily because of Packet Tracer's limitation as a program as opposed
to a virtualized environment such as GNS3 or Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)
