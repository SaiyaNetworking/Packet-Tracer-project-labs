This network topology is simply a proof-of-concept or a "what would I do to make this current situation even better for everyone" that I 
happened to cobble together. Most of this is based off of what I have learned from the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and 
general best practices that people would commonly agree on. There will be quite a few different things that would be missing from a 
traditional network such as EtherChannels, load-balancing, fail=overs, controller-based networking, dynamic routing and more granular firewall policies. 
I omitted these because I went with a "simplicity with elegance" philosophy because of three reasons:

1) Correctly-implemented networks are virtually bulletproof and should be considered as such.
2) I feel like this would be a good blueprint for any small business that can't hire/contract a dedicated network engineer could find a 
good use off of this template.
3) There are far more qualified network engineers than me that would see flaws in my implementation and their diagrams should be followed if
your business does have such network engineers.

This specific small-business example is based off of my past few jobs of having the privilege to see the different networks of the 
businesses in question and having the opportunity to say "I can make this even better and more efficient." Some aspects I have been 
able to implement. Others I have not due to constraints. Either way, I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to work with said 
networks in the first place where I had no prior network experience in a business environment.

Why Packet Tracer?
It's one of the easier templates to share. Something hosted on GNS3 or Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) would be more authentic, but Packet 
Tracer is a lot more straightforward.


~~note~~
This is simply a template because I haven't been able to find a similar template like this myself. I have seen quite a few rudimentary ones 
such as a 1990's star topology or Wide Area Network (WAN) networks but nothing like a small business that isn't an office. I do hope this 
will be a helpful to anyone aspiring to be a network engineer or even just clean up an antiquated network infrastructure. This specific 
template was designed for around 20-25 end users and a rotation of 12-16 IoT devices being manufacture. Scalability has been considered up to 
double the workforce or roughly what the facility could manage before expansion of the facility itself would have to be considered.

INITIAL SETUP AND CONNECTIVITY

local account or controller of your choice. This is an example in Packet Tracer:


LOGIN/VTY

~~Local Account~~
username admin privilege 15 secret password
ip domain-name cisco.com
crypto key generate rsa
2048 keys
ip ssh version 2

~~Remote Terminal Login~~
line vty 0 4
login local
transport input ssh


``````````````````````````````
VLANS

This is set up for 9 vlans with a marginal amount of hosts for the assumed capacity of the environment and to act as a 
proof-of-concept of managing IPv4 addresses. The maximum hosts per the CIDR notations below are:
/24 = 254 hosts
/25 = 126 hosts
/26 = 62 hosts
/27 = 30 hosts
/28 = 14 hosts
/29 = 6 hosts
/30 = 4 hosts

In a real-world deployment that doesn't rely on public IPv4's for a small business, you would primarily stick to just using 
a /24 subnet for easy readability, scalability and to reduce the potential of an accidental misconfiguration. Being able to 
read (as will be seen):
10.0.1.0 - mgmt
10.0.2.0 - sales
10.0.3.0 - engineering
10.0.4.0 - machine shop
10.0.5.0 - shipping & receiving (and et cetera)

is a lot easier to comprehend visually than:
10.0.0.0 - mgmt
10.0.0.16 - sales
10.0.0.32 - engineering
10.0.0.96 - machine shop
10.0.0.104 - shipping & receiving
10.0.0.112 - assembly + tech
10.0.0.176 - VOIP
10.0.0.208 - server
10.0.0.212 - everything else and onward.


For VLANs that require management or point-to-point connectivity though, /24-28 should be used for management to restrict unauthorized 
access and point-to-point connectivity should be done on /30 subnets. Some vendors like Cisco and more modern hardware supports /31 subnets, but others like Microsoft Azure will reject /31 subnets.


~~Vlan profile~~

1) Mgmt (4 users + phones) /28	10.0.1.0 VLAN 10
2) Sales (4 users + testing devices + phones) /28 10.0.2.0 VLAN 20
3) Engineering (8 users + testing devices + phones) /26 10.0.3.0 VLAN 30
4) Machine shop (4 users + devices + phones) /29 10.0.4.0 VLAN 40
5) Shipping + Receiving (4 users + phones) /29 10.0.5.0 VLAN 50
6) Assembly + tech (64 users/devices + 1 phone) /26 OR /25 10.0.6.0 VLAN 60
7) VOIP (30 phones) /27 10.0.7.0 VLAN 70
8) Server /30 10.0.8.0 VLAN 80
9) Guest WiFi /24 10.0.9.0 VLAN 90


-Engineering has to be able to reach tech via interVLAN routing, so no ACL blocking pinging from VLAN 30 to VLAN 60
-Everyone has to reach Server 1 for inventory updates.
-Native VLAN 10 (just for the wireless in Packet Tracer. Normally there would be an OOB management port and a native vlan, 
but Packet Tracer won't allow it for the WLC. Or I'm just misconfiguring within the confines of Packet Tracer. Either way, OOB and native in a real deployment)

Max Scale that can reasonably be supported before a new facility would need to be rented or purchased:
50 end users
20 VOIP phones
20-30 IoT devices being tested


~~Vlans~~

Management and HR are rolled into one VLAN due to small business environment (i.e. many hats for one to four people.)

~~IP addresses~~

This is to assign the initial IP addresses for the specific interfaces. We will use inter-vlan routing. 203.0.113.1 is the "public"
IP address and the loopback addresses are to keep an accessible logical interface in case a port fails. The layer 2 switches will
have IP interfaces on vlan 10 to allow remote accessibility from the management vlan.

Gateway:
int g0/1
ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0

~~Switchport trunk~~

Your trunk ports are to allow the *allowed* vlans to transmit out to the central aggregator and to restrict access to other vlans 
from different areas or unauthorized areas of the building. This is to prevent people from doing reconnaissance and drive-by network-mapping (Nmap for example) of your network infrastructure while maintaining proper work flow.

DHCP SERVICES

For simplicity's sake for any system administrator and the Packet Tracer lab, DHCP will be on the gateway. On a larger 
scale or a system administrator could always implement DHCP on a local server. The excluded address pools can be larger 
to include printer services but is generally assumed there is only a couple to a few communal printers and a dedicated 
large-format printer. A controller of choice will make this a lot easier to deploy than the Cisco CLI but this will serve 
as good, easy-to-follow framework.

IP x.x.x.0 in these networks are always the network address and are reserved to identify the network through the routing protocol. 
IP x.x.x.255 is the broadcast address and is always reserved for the broadcasting protocol. 
IP x.x.x.1 is reserved for the gateway addresses for the vlans
Any other IP address can be excluded if you need to set up a static IP address for a server, printer, network hardware, etc.

This is to enable the Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) on Cisco devices and to disable Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) 
to prevent Yersernia-type attacks and use LLDP on the backbone of the network or the portion that isn't accessible 
to end-users. This won't really matter if you don't use Cisco.

PORT SECURITY AND DHCP SNOOPING
DHCP snooping is to prevent rogue DHCP clients and routers setting up access in your network. Be mindful some companies 
might require a double-NAT for old equipment (90's - 2000's era) that is hardcoded for broadcasts in the class C or 
class B domains. DHCP snooping **should not be enabled** if you need to set up extra NAT translations for segmented equipment.

~~DHCP Snooping~~

ip dhcp snooping trust


~~Port Security~~
Port Security is a protocol that monitors for PC's or equipment that should not be plugged into that specific ethernet 
port leading to the switch. For this lab set up, we will use the two different port-security violation options:

- Violation shutdown: shuts the port down and will not turn on again until management reenables it. Will log a violation.
- Violation protect: remains enabled but will stop unauthorized hardware from transmitting on the port. Won't log a violation.

 Interfaces with the violation shutdown should never have their desktop PC's changed for anything else and should be treated as an 
emergency/alert. Interfaces with the violation protect are assumed to be accidentally or unintentionally changed or swapped (such 
as sales wanting to test an IoT device within their vlan.) This is to prevent potential losses in sales and downtime. Testing 
should be within the designated Engineering or Manu_Tech VLANs even if there has to be a designated interface introduced.

Two other options will be enabled which are the maximum allowed MAC-addresses saved on a port and dynamic MAC-address learning. This
will prevent swapping out designated desktop PC's for laptops, rogue Pi's, or other hardware.

Company IoT's will specifically have a designated Named Access Control List (NACL) to control inbound and outbound traffic to the 
rented server, local VLAN, and SSH. Any other ports should be blocked unless reason is needed to whitelist certain ports for needed 
API traffic. Any other IoT like smart devices (coffee machines, fridges, personal printers) should either be shunted into its own 
VLAN or even its own dedicated ISP line.

*Note* It's very important to mitigate and control open ports to prevent backdoors into the network from rouge AP's using cellular 
or drive-by network scanning attacks. Have everything clearly documented and labeled to maintain a sanitized environment.

Named Access Control Lists (NACL's)
Like any other good firewall, you want to control and only whitelist what's absolutely necessary to prevent exfiltration or 
any rogue servers from communicating outward. VLAN segmentation should be as controlled as possible without random successful 
ping to other end-user devices.

~~~MLS ACL's~~~
-None of the VLANs should be able to ping the Mgmt VLAN
-Mgmt VLAN should be able to ping everyone else
-VLANS should be isolated from pinging eachother EXCEPT Eng VLAN 30 to Manu_Tech VLAN 60
-Manu-Tech VLAN should not be able to ping Eng VLAN 30
-Everyone should be able to ping server 10.0.8.2
-Everyone should be able to ping Gateway 192.168.1.1

WIRELESS LAN CONTROLLER
Cisco Packet Tracer is very....buggy and limited with the web GUI for the WLC. Supposedly Packet Tracer doesn't support 
wireless DHCP leasing and a lot of the available options are limited. I left the only two accessible WLANS as "test" for 
the initial setup and "guest" for basic connectivity. In the real world you can add both a guest and employee SSID. This 
is only a placeholder because Packet Tracer is a real pain to deal with.

Another issue seems to be the LWAP won't connect to the WLC unless it's through untagged traffic (so native vlan would be 
the mgmt vlan, too.) Since the DHCP leasing seems to bug out when the program reloads, the LWAPS won't reach the WLC unless 
statically configured. This is only theory currently because Packet Tracer isn't Cisco Modeling Labs or GNS3 so I can't 
definitely say I didn't do a bad configuration and broke something somewhere. What I can confirm is the initial DHCP setup did 
work at the time prior to reloading the Packet Tracer program. I might tack on a secondary Packet Tracer lab as a proof-of-concept.

BUDGET:

With a small deployment like this where you could even collapse the L3 switch into the router using a gateway,
a limited budget is of little concern if your main purchase option are MicroTik, Ubiquiti or TP-Link. The only basic
cons are that:
- MicroTik has a learning curve to it due to the RouterOS setup.
- Ubiquiti demands you have cold spares if you want to maintain Recovery Time Objectives.
- TP-Link has dubious connections with the CCP, a very infamous entity that has "estimated to cost the taxpayer 
$600 billion per year" from a 2023 letter sent from Chairman Gallagher to Attorney General Garland. The 2024 
European hacking campaign has brought considerable scrutiny on TP-Link.

While not recommended for a business that requires availability or redundancy or a serious enterprise environment, I'll 
use Ubiquiti as our ballpark example due to familiarity, including cold spares:

- Dream Machine Pro (gateway) @ 379.00 x 2 = 758
- Standard 24 PoE (layer 2 switch) @ 379.00 x4 = 1,516.00
- Pro 24 PoE (layer 3 switch) @ 699.00 x 2 = 1398.00
- U6+ LWAP @ 129.00 x 4 = 516.00

Grand sum = $4,188.00

A very modest budget to pull out a lopsided/unmanaged network infrastructure and update it to being relatively secure with a
reasonable disaster recovery in place. If even a modest budget is out of the reach of a small business or a nonprofit entity, the cold 
spares can be subtracted and the layer 3 switch collapsed into the gateway:

- Dream Machine Pro (gateway) @ 379.00 x 1 = 379.00
- Standard 24 PoE (layer 2 switch) @ 379.00 x2 = 758.00
- U6+ LWAP @ 129.00 x 3 = 387.00

Grand sum = $1,524.00

Much cheaper, but it should be noted that any hardware failure will *AT LEAST* put your business out of any IP services for a week until 
a new hardware item comes in, and if bought from Amazon, there's no guarantee the shipped item will even be authentic or new.


And if one wanted to shrink this down for a small office:

- Unifi Express 7 (gateway w/ wifi) @ 199.00 x 1 = 199.00
- Ultra 60W (layer 2 switch) @ 159.00 x 1 = 159.00
- U6+ LWAP @ 129.00 x 1 = 129.00

Grand sum = $487.00

Just a basic small office environment. The most important part will be the switch for setting up an AP or two across the office floor.


RECOMMENDED UPGRADES:

A collapsed core, 2-tier model with two routers facing separate ISP's. This is to facilitate high availability and redundancy for 
a small business that would require near-constant access to the internet to either function or maintain revenue. Major hardware should 
be considered as well with a quick RMA or replacement. Cisco would be a good example and the increased pricing should be accepted as 
opposed to the potential loss of revenue. Load balancing, failovers, and other configurations should be accounted for as well.
