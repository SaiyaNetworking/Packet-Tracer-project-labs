Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix answer key:

IPv6 addresses are a very straightforward process for the CCNA lab exams. What will be needed mostis to both be able to read what the exam is asking you (ex. use the next available subnet than the one listed) and to remember to enable the unicast-routing protocol.

~~Routers 1 and 2~~
Steps 1 and 2:

	R1(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing			//enable IPv6 routing (step 2)
	R1(config)#int g0/0
	R1(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8::1/64	//apply static IPv6 (step 1)
	R1(config-if)#no shutdown			//turn on the interface

	R2(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing
	R2(config)#int g0/0
	R2(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8::2/64
	R2(config-if)#no shutdown

Step 3:

	R1#show ipv6 interface brief			//verify the IPv6 address is applied to the interface
	R2#show ipv6 interface brief 
	R1#ping 2001:db8::2				//verify that R1 can ping R2's IPv6 interface
	R2#ping 2001:db8::1				//verify R2 can ping R1's interface


~~Routers 3 and 4~~
Steps 1 and 2:

	R3(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing
	R3(config)#int g0/0
	R3(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8::/64 eui-64 	//apply a dynamic IPv6 address using the interface's MAC address
	R3(config-if)#no shutdown

	R4(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing
	R4(config)#int g0/0
	R4(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8::/64 eui-64
	R4(config-if)#no shutdown

Step 3:

	R3#show ipv6 interface brief			//show the unique IPv6 address on the interface
	R4#show ipv6 interface brief
	R3#ping [unique IPv6 address]			//ex: ping 2001:DB8::205:5EFF:FE20:5201
	R4#ping [unique IPv6 address]			//ex: ping 2001:DB8::204:9AFF:FEDA:8B01




As you can see, while learning the rigors of IPv4 addressing, IPv6 seems like an extremely daunting task to learn and understand, but when given the chance to practice, it can be just as straightforward (and even more preferable!) than IPv4 addressing.

Note: You may see an extra address under the "show ipv6 interface brief" command that starts with "FE80::". This is a link-local address, an address automatically configured on every IPv6-enabled network interface that allows certain IPv6 protocols to function like the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)


Don't forget to use the "copy run start" command to save any configuration changes to not lose any points on your CCNA labs.
